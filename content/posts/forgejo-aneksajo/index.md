  A Forgejo-variant offers the smoothest approach to DataLad dataset hosting, yet.
---

If we are being honest, hosting DataLad datasets is not the most
straightforward thing in the world. Sure, through the power of
[git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com), and with the help of a range of
[DataLad extension
packages](https://github.com/datalad/datalad-extensions?tab=readme-ov-file#datalad-extensions-status)
they can be put pretty much anywhere. But the fact that it is possible does not imply simplicity.

There used to be a time when [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) supported
git-annex repositories directly. But with the arrival of [Git
LFS](https://git-lfs.com) it got
[removed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1648). And Git LFS is
really no match for git-annex data logistics, so none of the big hosting solutions
offer any help here.

From the beginning, DataLad offered a [simple web UI for read-only browsing of
datasets](https://datasets.datalad.org). But for the longest time,
[GIN](https://gin.g-node.org) was, to my knowledge, the only complete hosting
solution with built-in git-annex support. There is a public instance, and it
allows for private repositories. But not all data can be uploaded to this
science-focused service. Although GIN is open-source (a fork of
[Gogs](https://gogs.io)) and can be
[self-hosted](https://gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/In+House), setting it up
isn't so straightforward either, and its development has not kept up with Gogs
over the years.

Not so long ago, the [forking of Forgejo from
Gitea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gitea#Forgejo_fork) brought some change to
the Git hosting landscape. [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) is now the solution
underlying [codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org), a Git forge [hosting >100k
projects with ~90k users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codeberg). It is backed
by a
[non-profit](https://docs.codeberg.org/getting-started/what-is-codeberg/#what-is-codeberg-e.v.%3F),
specifically focused on keeping the software free and open-source (unlike the
open-core models of alternatives like GitLab). Moreover, Forgejo
is specifically aiming to be a self-hosted alternative to GitHub that offers "a
familiar environment to GitHub users, allowing a smooth transition to a platform
you own".

And now there is [forgejo-aneksajo](https://codeberg.org/matrss/forgejo-aneksajo),
a Forgejo variant that adds support for git-annex 🤯.

[Matthias Riße](https://codeberg.org/matrss) is presently pushing this effort.
It is based on earlier work by [Nick Guenther](https://github.com/kousu) and
others (see https://github.com/neuropoly/gitea). I have first heard about it at
[distribits 2024](https://distribits.live) in [his unconference
contribution](https://youtu.be/J14GiX1kuto?si=2FSc2OZ37VngMVrs&t=753).  It was
originally built on [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com) and continues to be used
for the [Atmospheric Research Data Information
System](https://atris.fz-juelich.de) (ATRIS) at [Forschungszentrum
Jülich](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en).

If you are wondering, like I was: "aneksaĵo" is Esperanto for "annex", just
like "forĝejo" is Esperanto for "forge". Forgejo-aneksajo is an annex forge.

## Self-hosting on a Raspberry Pi

> Also check out [this follow-up post](/posts/forgejo-aneksajo-podman-deployment)
for a podman/system-based deployment, entirely in user-space.

My aims were similar to that of my setup for [self-hosted music streaming
from a DataLad dataset](posts/navidrome). I want everything to run on my
series 5 [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi). Ideally,
it would run as an additional service, and due to its low requirements not
require its own machine. I was hoping for the setup complexity to be minimal.
And even more, I was hoping for *not* having to interact with the UI a lot, and
certainly *not* having to learn another API.

With Forgejo-aneksajo being Forgejo with git-annex support, the deployment should be
similar to vanilla Forgejo. That one is advertised to be "Easy to install and
maintain. Hosting your own software forge does not require expert skills." Nice.

I decide to go for a [Docker](https://www.docker.com)-based installation. In
contrast to Forgejo, no Docker images are readily available for
Forgejo-aneksajo, and they need to be built.  Knowing that one can build a
software helps to gain confidence that things can actually be fixed when there
is a need, so self-building is fine. However, the `docker` v20 that I installed from
the standard package sources of Debian 12.6 (stable) on my Raspberry Pi with

```
$ sudo apt install docker.io
```

could not do it out-of-the-box.  It needs the [buildx
plugin](https://github.com/docker/buildx). Fortunately, it can be added to the
Debian Docker installation, and I did not need to replace it entirely. Binaries
are available from the project's releases on GitHub. I did

```
$ mkdir -p ~/.docker/cli-plugins
$ wget -O ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx \
    https://github.com/docker/buildx/releases/download/v0.16.1/buildx-v0.16.1.linux-arm64
$ chmod +x ~/.docker/cli-plugins/docker-buildx
```

and had `docker buildx` working. In order to be able to interact with Docker
using my normal user account, I added myself to the `docker` group.  This
should not be done carelessly. Members of this group have elevated permissions
on the system.

```
$ sudo adduser $(id -u -n) docker
```

From here, building the Docker image was straightforward. Clone the repository

```
$ git clone git@codeberg.org:matrss/forgejo-aneksajo.git
```

and let Docker build the image based on the included `Dockerfile`.

```shell
$ cd forgejo-aneksajo
# check out the specific version we want to build here
$ git checkout v7.0.5-git-annex1
$ docker buildx build --output type=docker \
    --tag forgejo-aneksajo:7.0.5-git-annex1 --tag forgejo-aneksajo:7-git-annex .
```

The build took 18 min on the Raspberry Pi. It was twice as fast on my laptop. The
outcome was a 300 MB image.

```
$ docker images
REPOSITORY         TAG                IMAGE ID       CREATED              SIZE
forgejo-aneksajo   7-git-annex        c95a6115bc49   About a minute ago   293MB
...
```

Next, I set up a system user and a location on the host system for Forgejo to
deposit files and directories outside the container. I went for a `forgejo`
system user and a `forgejo` group. For reasons specific to my Raspberry Pi
setup, I put the `forgejo` system user home directory at `/home/forgejo` and
used that as its main data directory.

```
$ sudo addgroup --system forgejo
Adding group `forgejo' (GID 115) ...
Done.

$ sudo adduser --system  --ingroup forgejo --home /home/forgejo forgejo
Adding system user `forgejo' (UID 109) ...
Adding new user `forgejo' (UID 109) with group `forgejo' ...
Creating home directory `/home/forgejo' ...
```

Now, I could start the container. There are many ways to do this, and the 
[Forgejo docs](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/installation-docker)
recommend using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose). I did not
want another piece and used `docker run` directly.

```
$ docker run \
    --detach \
    --rm \
    --name forgejo \
    --hostname forgejo \
    --env "USER_UID=109" \
    --env "USER_GID=115" \
    -v /home/forgejo:/data \
    -v /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro \
    -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
    -p '3000:3000' \
    -p '2222:22' \
    forgejo-aneksajo:7-git-annex
```

This long-ish command more or less reflects the docker-compose configuration.
Important is to pass the `UID`/`GID` of the `forgejo` user to the container,
and to expose (`-p`) the ports of the web UI and the Forgejo SSH server. The
latter I wanted to listen on port `2222` on the host, because `22` was already
used by another server. We will get back to that in a second.

I set up my home network to make the Forgejo web UI available at
`http://git.pididdy.local` using a DNS configuration in
[Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net), and a reverse proxy setting in
[caddy](https://caddyserver.com), both also running on the Raspberry Pi.  This
is not necessary at all, but I like it that way.

With this done, I could go to `http://git.pididdy.local` and be greeted by
Forgejo with the initial setup. I left everything at default, except for
removing the "Git LFS root path" (I do not want Git LFS), and I changed the
"SSH server port" to `2222`. The latter reflects where my setup exposes
SSH access to Forgejo and it makes Forgejo show the correct SSH URLs in
its UI.

At this point, one could configure more things, like email, or an admin
account. I did not do any of that. Email is not required. And without a
dedicated admin account, the first registered user automatically becomes admin
too. Importantly, by default Forgejo uses SQLite. You can configure a proper
SQL server, but for small-ish deployments this can be avoided and helps
substantially with keeping the maintenance burden low.

There was one last thing to do: Enable git-annex support. For that, I added
a config setting to the main configuration file.

```
$ sudo -u forgejo sh -c 'printf "\n[annex]\nENABLED = true\n" \
    >> /home/forgejo/gitea/conf/app.ini'
```

After a restart of the container

```
$ docker restart forgejo
```

everything was working, I could register a user, sign-in, create and
interact with projects.


## Great!

The Forgejo UI felt snappy, despite running on a Raspberry Pi. It has all the
goodness that I am used to from GitHub and friends. Pushing, and then browsing
a DataLad dataset with hundreds of commits and several 10k files was fast and
did not make Forgejo sweat (nor the Raspberry Pi).

Forgejo, unlike GitHub, does not limit the number of items in a directory
listing.  So when I pushed a test repository with 45k submodules (yes, 45k), it
struggled loading the page completely. That being said, the UI remained
responsive, albeit with a high latency. At the same time, the system load
remained at less than 2%.  The issue with (root) directories with many items [is already
known](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues/3547).

Most importantly, DataLad interoperability was instant -- no fiddling required.
Transfer of annexed files to and from Forgejo worked fast and reliably. Forgejo
shows the size of a repository, including the annexed file content. I can click
on annexed music or video files and play them directly from the Forgejo UI.

## Amazing!

At this point I was quite happy already. But Forgejo also supports
[push-to-create](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/push-to-create). So I added

```
[repository]
...
ENABLE_PUSH_CREATE_USER = true
ENABLE_PUSH_CREATE_ORG = true
```

to the `app.ini` configuration file, and restarted the Docker container.

Now I can go to any repository or DataLad dataset, add a remote and push
immediately -- no required interaction with the web UI whatsoever. This means that
the commands

```
$ git remote add pididdy ssh://git@git.pididdy.local:2222/mih/mydataset.git
$ datalad push --to pididdy
```

are 100% sufficient for depositing a dataset on my Forgejo-aneksajo instance, including all annexed file contents.

This is absolutely amazing, because it requires no learning of any API, no
implementation of a dedicated create-me-a-project command when one needs to
work with a thousand datasets, no separate API token, etc. Just push-to-create.
Forgejo even extends this approach to the [creation of
pull-requests](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/user/agit-support).

This is amazingly simple and useful. It allows anyone who is not interested
in web UIs to stick to whatever Git-powered workflow they have, and still
collaborate with people who prefer or need a graphical interface.
I love it!


## Behind the curtain

When running a large or institutional deployment, a certain complexity
of a service setup is to be expected, for example from integrations
with identity providers for single-sign-on, or storage systems.

For a small home or lab deployment expectations are different.  Maintenance
requirements should be low. There should be an "exit strategy" for when a
solution can no longer be employed, and a migration is needed. What is
necessary to do an effective backup?  What would disaster recovery look like?

The Forgejo documentation provides [instructions on doing
backups](https://forgejo.org/docs/latest/admin/upgrade/#backup), and a look
at the directory structure in its working directory shows a clean separation
of repository data and Forgejo database and assets.

```
$ tree /home/forgejo -d
/home/forgejo
├── git
│   └── repositories
│       └── <orgname/username>
│           └── <reponame>.git
│               ├── annex
│               │   ├── <hashdir_lower annex>
│               │   └── ...
│               ├── <bare git repo>
│               └── ...
├── gitea
│   └── <Forgejo DB and assets>
└── ssh
```

All repository data, including their annexes, are in the `git/repositories/`
directory. They are organized by user account or organization. Each repository
is a standard bare Git repository. If it has an annex, it is using the
`hashdir-lower` object tree layout that is the standard for bare repositories.
This means that these repositories in this exact organization could also be
used directly, for example for cloning and annex-get'ing data, even when the
whole Forgejo database is no longer accessible.

It was good to see that user sign-ups can easily be disabled entirely in the
configuration file.

```
[service]
DISABLE_REGISTRATION = true
```

For small deployments it is often much more feasible and also leaner to have an
admin create the few necessary accounts manually (via the web UI), rather than
setting up email, or OpenID, or having to deal with spam and abuse coming for
an open sign-up feature.


## Takeaways

I think this is the best solution for self-hosting DataLad datasets that is
around at this point. It is easy to deploy. It runs on a Raspberry Pi just
fine, so it will run on pretty much anything that any lab will have in use. The
user interface is pleasant to work with and feels intuitive. The necessary
buy-in (how much one needs to adjust and adapt when adopting Forgejo-aneksajo)
is low -- if anything it is even lower than with GitHub or GitLab, considering
the push-to-create feature.  The risk of adoption also feels low. Forgejo
itself is very actively developed and the enthusiasm on social media for it
(`#forgejo`) seems substantial. Of course, the git-annex add-on by
Forgejo-aneksajo is an independently developed smaller project that can
hopefully be integrated with Forgejo directly, or at least attract a good number of
contributors to ensure its continued development.

Is the git-annex integration offered by Forgejo-aneksajo perfect already? No.
The [issue tracker](https://codeberg.org/matrss/forgejo-aneksajo/issues)
documents problems and opportunities. But does it work?
Absolutely!

After this first test, I will definitely keep using it at home, and will look
into further adoption at work, and making sure that DataLad continues to work
well with Forgejo-aneksajo!
